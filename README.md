I created a hands on assignment for the class CSCI 313 Software Development using Frameworks.
This assignment has the students follow the instructions on a word doc to get step by step hands on experience using the Basics, Intermediates and Advanced features of GitHub.

This Assignment has you learn:
Console Commands
-cd
-add
-commit
-push
-fetch
-pull

The What, How and Whys of:
-Forking a repository
-Cloning a repository
-Adding, Committing and Pushing
-Conflicts and every way to resolve them
-Making Branches
-Merging Branches
-Using VS Code tools for GitHub
-Reverting to a previous commit
-Making and resolving a pull request

The instructions are comprehensive and explanitory so students should be able to refer back to it for any trouble with GitHub in the future for any project.
